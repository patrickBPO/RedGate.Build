.SYNOPSIS
  Zip a list of files into a .zip archive
.DESCRIPTION
  Uses 7zip to create a zip file containing files matching
  filename patterns passed in as $Files
.EXAMPLE
  New-ZipArchive -OutputFile .\Build\Build.zip -BasePath .\Build -Files ".\Build\Release\*.exe", ".\Build\Release\*.dll"

    Packages all .exe and .dll files within Build\Release\ to a zip file created at Build\Build.zip
    Strips the -BasePath value from the file paths in the archive.
    Paths in the archive will be:
      Release\myproject.exe
      Release\mydll1.dll
      Release\mydll2.dll

.NOTES
    Currently zipping using 7z.exe, just because it proved faster at the time of writing as the equivalent powershell based solutions.
